# Daisy_world
A 3D-Daisyworld visualization model 

Daisyworld is a planetary toy model first designed by Lovelock in the early 1980s to study the impact of life on the global temperature of the earth. The model consider two species of daisy: black and white. Earth is approximated to a grey box where all major environmental phenomena are neglected. Only the interplay between surface temperature, albedo, daisy growth rate, and solar incoming radiation is taken into account in the mathematical modeling. 

The literature on the subject is vast. For those interested in a summery of the subject you car refer to: Wood, Andrew J., et al. "Daisyworld: A review." Reviews of Geophysics 46.1 (2008).
